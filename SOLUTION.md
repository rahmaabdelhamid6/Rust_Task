# Solution

Here you can document all bugs and design flaws.
## Deliverables

1. Updated Server Implementation
   - Fully functional server that adheres to the multithreading requirements.
            the updated code for the server with multithreading support (server.rs and client.rs).
2. Test Suite Results
   - Evidence (e.g., logs) that your server passes all tests.
            "Added as Screenshots of successful test execution from the test suite are saved in the folder test_results"
   - Any additional test cases added to (client_test.rs).
            "Added as a .txt document in the folder named 'additional_test_cases.txt'."
3. Documentation:
   - Inline comments in the code to explain significant changes.
            Inline comments exist in the provided code files for both the server and client and client_test.
   - Bug Analysis and Fix Report
            "Added as a .txt document in the folder named 'Bug_Analysis_and_Fix_Report.txt'."
4. A brief document outlining:
   - The identified bugs in the initial implementation.
            "Added as a .txt document in the folder named 'Brief_Document'."
   - How architectural flaws were addressed.
            "Added as a .txt document in the folder named 'Brief_Document'."
