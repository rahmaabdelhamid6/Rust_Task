# **Brief Document**
## **Identified Bugs in the Initial Implementation**

1.Lack of Multithreading:
-The server was handling one client at a time, causing delays and failing to support concurrent client connections effectively.
2.Missing Synchronization:
-No mechanisms were in place to ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources, risking data inconsistency and potential race conditions.
3.Insufficient Error Handling:
-Errors during message encoding, decoding, or network operations were not logged or handled comprehensively, leading to reduced reliability and maintainability.
4.Blocking Behavior:
-Blocking operations in the server's client-handling loop caused inefficiencies and increased latency.
5.Limited Logging:
Logs lacked clarity and coverage, making it difficult to diagnose issues or track server activities.

## **Addressing Architectural Flaws**

1. Introduction of Multithreading:
-Used Rust’s std::thread to spawn a new thread for each client connection, enabling concurrent handling of multiple clients.
2. Thread Safety with Synchronization Mechanisms:
-Implemented Arc<AtomicBool> to safely share and modify the server’s running state across threads.
-Ensured thread-safe operations when managing shared resources, reducing the risk of data corruption.
3. Enhanced Error Handling:
-Added comprehensive error checks for all I/O and network operations.
-Used log crate to log detailed error messages, warnings, and information about system state and operations.
4. Non-blocking and Efficient Design:
-Set the server socket to non-blocking mode to prevent the main thread from stalling.
-Reduced CPU usage with efficient sleep intervals (thread::sleep) in non-critical loops.
5. Improved Logging:
-Extended logging coverage to include client connection and disconnection events, error details, and server lifecycle status.
-Used structured logging to improve the readability and utility of logs for debugging and monitoring.
6. Documentation Improvements
- Added inline comments throughout the codebase to explain significant changes and provide context for complex logic.
- Prepared comprehensive reports on identified bugs, architectural flaws, and their fixes.

## **Summary of Improvements**

-The updated implementation adheres to the specified functional and technical requirements.
-The server now supports concurrent client connections, ensuring scalability.
-Synchronization mechanisms prevent race conditions and maintain data consistency.
-Comprehensive error handling and detailed logging enhance reliability and maintainability.
-Optimized design reduces unnecessary delays and improves performance under high loads.
